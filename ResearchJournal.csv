leftDoubleImage,1. Mouchette 1,,"Mouchette.org is an ongoing interactive artwork by artist Martine Neddam,  under the guise of character Mouchette, a deeply troubled twelve-year-old 'artist' from Amsterdam. First created in 1996, The site consists of a maze of confusing, often non-sennsical, often unmarked pages, including poems, visuals, electronic interactive forms, and contributions from site users. The site was published at a time before social media, when html sites offering interactivity were the closest thing to virtual community. Today, the largely unchanged basic styling offers a nostalgic glimpse to the early internet. GIFs, secret links, sound effects, dead ends, and buttons result in a playful interaction akin to a videogame.
The site is also darkly sexual and morbid, with strong suicide themes. Contributors even write in their own thoughts of sucide and self-harm.
The site's elusive voyeuristic nature has resulted in a massive fan-base obsessed with the mysterious character. The interactive aspect means that the site is constantly updated, and viewers are engaged by feeling involved and close to the author. ",/,/,"Screenshot Mouchette main menu page.

Foreword: ""although it is made of letters, is not meant to tell a story. We are accustomed to poetry as music, metered and rhythmic. Visual poetry like Adam's is like sculpture."" The website is very basic with a side navigational bar featuring areas and subsections, with a title at the top. Each section is a series of slides which take up a small amount of the right-section, and can be scrolled through.",/,/,,,https://www.cddc.vt.edu/digitaloriginals/afeeld/?output/this-is-visual-poetry/,,,,,,,,,
